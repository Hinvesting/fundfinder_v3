## How to Search for Funding

FundFinder uses advanced AI to find funding opportunities that match your specific needs and location.

### Step 1: Enter Your Location

Be as specific as possible for best results:
- ✅ **Good**: "Seattle, Washington"
- ✅ **Better**: "King County, Washington"
- ❌ **Too vague**: "USA"

**Why location matters**: Our AI prioritizes local opportunities first:
1. **City-level grants** (e.g., Seattle Small Business Grant)
2. **County programs** (e.g., King County Innovation Fund)
3. **State initiatives** (e.g., Washington State Loans)
4. **National programs** (only if specific to your industry)

### Step 2: Describe Your Business Type

Tell us what kind of business you have:
- "Tech Startup"
- "Restaurant"
- "Retail Store"
- "Non-profit Organization"
- "Manufacturing Company"
- "Service Business"

**Pro Tip**: Be specific! "Sustainable fashion startup" gives better results than just "startup".

### Step 3: Explain Your Funding Purpose

What do you need funding for?
- Equipment purchases
- Business expansion
- Working capital
- Inventory
- Marketing campaigns
- Hiring employees
- Research & development

**Example**: "Need $10,000 for commercial kitchen equipment to expand catering services"

### Step 4: Get Your Results

Click **"Find Funding with AI"** and wait 5-10 seconds.

You'll receive **3 personalized funding opportunities**, each showing:
- **Name**: The grant, loan, or investor program
- **Type**: Grant, Loan, or Investor
- **Amount**: Funding range available
- **Deadline**: When to apply by
- **Link**: Direct application URL
- **Match Reason**: Why this is perfect for you

## Understanding Search Results

### Geographic Matching

FundFinder's AI understands geography and prioritizes local opportunities:

**Example Search**: "Restaurant in Brooklyn, NY"

**You'll Get**:
1. Brooklyn Restaurant Equipment Grant (City)
2. NYC Small Business Loan Program (City)
3. New York State Restaurant Recovery Fund (State)

**You Won't Get**:
- Generic national loans without specific programs
- Funding from other states
- Irrelevant venture capital (for traditional restaurants)

### Business Type Intelligence

The AI knows what type of funding makes sense for your business:

**Tech Startup** → You'll see:
- Accelerator programs
- Angel investor networks
- Innovation grants
- Pre-seed funds

**Local Restaurant** → You'll see:
- Equipment grants
- Small business loans
- Community development financing
- Microloans

**Not**: Venture capital (unless you're a tech/high-growth concept)

---

## Tips for Best Results

### 🎯 Be Specific with Location

**Instead of**: "California"  
**Try**: "San Francisco, California" or "San Francisco Bay Area"

**Why**: More specific locations unlock city and county programs that have less competition.

### 🏢 Describe Your Business Accurately

**Instead of**: "Startup"  
**Try**: "B2B SaaS startup" or "Food delivery startup"

**Why**: Helps AI match you with industry-specific funding.

### 💡 Explain Your Use Case

**Instead of**: "Need money"  
**Try**: "Need $25,000 for inventory to fulfill large retail order"

**Why**: Clear purpose = better matches with specific grant requirements.

### 📍 Try Different Geographic Levels

Search multiple times with:
1. Your city (e.g., "Austin, Texas")
2. Your county (e.g., "Travis County, Texas")
3. Your state (e.g., "Texas")

**Why**: Different programs operate at different levels.

### 🔄 Search at Different Times

Your business needs change, and so do funding opportunities:
- **Quarterly**: New grant cycles
- **After pivot**: Changed business model
- **Growth stages**: Seed → Series A → Expansion

### 💾 Save Everything Interesting

Even if not ready to apply:
- Save for later review
- Share with co-founders
- Compare against future searches
- Track deadline patterns

We use Google's Gemini AI, trained to understand:
- Geographic funding landscapes
